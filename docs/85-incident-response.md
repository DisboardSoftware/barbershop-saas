# Incident Response

## Severity levels

- S1: critical outage or major security event.
- S2: significant degradation with user impact.
- S3: partial degradation or isolated failures.
- S4: low-impact or cosmetic issues.

## Triage steps

1. Confirm incident and scope.
2. Assign severity and incident owner.
3. Stabilize service (rollback/mitigation).
4. Document timeline and technical evidence.
5. Communicate status updates on fixed cadence.
